## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

The api is React, so we need these commands to run the application.
- run the application
    'npm start'
    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- run npm test
    'npm test'
    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- File structure
Todo:

- Changelog
For every update we make in the project we will add the Changelog. When we merge something make sure the Changelogs are correctly in order.
The changelog needs to be formatted:
dd-mm-jjjj - {what did you d0 add/update/remove can be more than one}: message/explanation.
29-03-2023 - create: new project with all project file's and structure.
