## Integrate with your tools

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](https://gitlab.com/anonymous0230/opensourceecommerce/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)

- [ ] [Automatically merge when pipeline succeeds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html)

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.

- [ ] [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html)
- [ ] [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing(SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
- [ ] [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
- [ ] [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

## Name
Open Source Ecommerce platform

## Description
The purpose of this project is to have a Commerce platform for businesses. They can change all the code themselves and add code to get more functionality. They can request a merge to give this functionality to all the other users. This Project will contain product and customer mismanagement. A api for the website. And a fronted that is combustible.

## Visuals
No Visuals yet

## Installation
Unable

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

The api is React so we need these commands to run the application.
- run the application
    'npm start'
    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- run npm test
    'npm test'
    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- File structure
The file structure contain is seperated by product. Folders are written without a capatol letter if it is one word.
If the word is a summery of words all the words start with a capital letter except for the first word. Abbreviated words are fully capatol.
these abbreviated words are writen in the readme file to explane them under Abbreviated words.

- Changelog
For every update we make in the project we will add the Changelog. When we merge something make sure the Changelogs are correctly in order.
The changelog needs to be formated:
dd-mm-jjjj - {what did you d0 add/update/remove can be more then one}: message/explenation.
29-03-2023 - create: new project with all project file's and structure.

## Support
questions can be send to Sebastiaan@game-x.nl

## Roadmap
- [ ] make config file
- [ ] workout database layout
- [ ] relase databese features

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
