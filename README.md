## Name
Open Source Ecommerce platform

## Description
The purpose of this project is to have a platform for businesses and projects. They can change all the code themselves and add code to get more functionality. They can request a merge to give this functionality to all the other users.

## Visuals
No Visuals yet

## Installation
- build and run applicaiton 
    'npm i'  to install all packages
    'npm install serve' install serves that runs the program
    'npm run build' makes a build from the project
    'serve -s build' runs the application

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

The api is React so we need these commands to run the application.
- run the application
    'npm start'
    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- run npm test
    'npm test'
    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- File structure
Todo:

- Changelog
For every update we make in the project we will add the Changelog. When we merge something make sure the Changelogs are correctly in order.
The changelog needs to be formated:
dd-mm-jjjj - {what did you d0 add/update/remove can be more then one}: message/explenation.
